HuGo!

This is a blackberry port of the PC-Engine, TG16 emulator 'HuGo'. An 8 bit console with 16bit graphics processors it was a cool little machine with some awesome arcade ports like R-Type, Salamander etc.  


- create misc\hugo
  add a tco.xml file here to override the default control layout

- create misc\roms\pce
- Put .zipped files in misc\roms\pce ( don't unzip them )

bugs: CD handling  requires a bios but it probably won't work due to
      some hacks I made. I need to look at this again.
