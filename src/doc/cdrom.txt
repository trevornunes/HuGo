 Introduction

This document briefly describes how to play pc engine 
games on cd with Hu-Go!. It is also useful for playing 
simple .iso files, just skip to "CD system rom configuration".

 CD drive configuration

Under Windows, CD-rom devices are automatically 
detected and the first one is used. It normally 
corresponds to the lower letter one. It can be changed 
but not easily.

Under Linux (as it is the only other platform 
supporting reading from raw cds), you must set the 
device path with the option called "CD path" if it's not "/dev/cdrom"
.

 CD system rom configuration

<sec:CD-system-rom>When playing cds or .iso files, Hu-Go! needs a cd 
system rom to provide the cd bios functions. To have 
Hu-go! automatically start it when loading a cd or .iso 
file, you must set the option "CD system filename" in the 
options. It should point to a rom which provides cd 
bios functions. Usually this rom is called "syscard.pce", "
syscard3.pce", "syscard30.pce",...

If you didn't set this option field, Hu-go! will try to 
find such a rom on your system, looking for names "syscard.pce"
, "syscard3.pce", "syscard30.pce", "cd-rom~1.pce" on the 
following locations : current Hu-Go! binary location, 
parent of Hu-Go! binary location, "c:\", "/usr/local/lib/hugo"
, "/usr/lib/hugo".

When you try to load a cd and no rom could be found, an 
error window will pop up.
