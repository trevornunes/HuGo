  <h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00020000000000000000">Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>This document briefly describes specifics of Hu-Go! on
  platforms others than Windows and linux.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00030000000000000000">Supported platforms</a></h1>

  <p>Hu-Go! has became quite portable and runs on manu platform
  even if not all are supported officially (due to lack of time,
  knowledge and hardware).</p>

  <p>Hu-Go! runs well on Solaris, FreeBsd. The same notes than
  Linux applies to them, excepted that cdrom isn't supported.</p>

  <p>Hu-Go! is ported for Xbox by Xport, and documentation for this
  port are included in its distribution.</p>

  <p>Hu-Go! is ported for BeOs, thanks to Caz. I don't have much
  details about it.</p>

  <p>Hu-Go! is also ported to Sheldows.</p>

  <p>Parts of Hu-Go! are found in GPEngine, the GP32 pc engine
  emulator.</p>

  <p>There are certainly other ports and or derived work. I'd be
  glad to hear about them and include them here.</p>

  <p>A dreamcast port is also in progress but I don't have much
  details.<br></p>
