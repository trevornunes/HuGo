 Introduction

This document briefly describes specifics of Hu-Go! on 
the Windows platforms.

 Supported versions

Hu-Go! has been reported to work on x86 windows in 
versions 95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, 2003 professional.

 Installation

Hu-Go! depends on gtk+ libraries. If you haven't yet a 
gtk+ 2.4 or newer version installed, you can either 
download the Hu-Go! + gtk+ bundle download and launch 
both setup .exe, or download and install gtk+ 
separately, on  Gimp-win download page 
(http://gimp-win.sf.net/stable.html).

It happens that if you have just installed gtk+ and 
Hu-Go! still refuses to run claiming to miss a library 
such as atk.dll, it is due to PATH changes which hasn't 
been yet taken in account. You can reboot your computer 
or go to the system properties, and in the environment 
variables, edit the PATH variable and just confirm it. 
It should already contain the PATH to gtk, but doing 
this appears to refresh it within the same session.

 CD Drive configuration

Under windows, you can't choose which CD drive to use. 
CD drives are autodetected and the first one is always used.
