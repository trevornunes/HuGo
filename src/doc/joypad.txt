 Introduction

This document briefly describes how to use your joypad 
with Hu-Go!. 

 Joypad configuration

Joypads are automatically recognized at startup and can 
be setup using the "Options->Input settings ..." item.

On the "Input Settings" window, the first field, called "
Configuration" is the configuration number. By default, 
it is number 0, but you can define up to configuration 
#15 to quickly switch between various configuration, 
such as one player with joypad, two players with 
joypads, one player on keyboard and one on joypad, ...

For each configuration, you have 5 tabs, one for each 
player. In each tab, you can change the key, joypad 
axis or joypad button assigned to each fonction by 
clicking on the button and then pressing the keyboard 
key, joypad axis or joypad button you want to assign. A 
little screen will popup in which you activate the 
desired key, axis or button. If a game is already in 
progress, the game screen is used instead.

If you want to remove an assignation, use the "ESC" key 
when prompted for the key, axis or button.

For the joypad itself, if you do not want to use one 
for the current player, set the "joystick" field to "0", 
else change it to fit the number of the joypad you want 
to use.
