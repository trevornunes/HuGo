 Introduction

This document briefly describes specifics of Hu-Go! on 
platforms others than Windows and linux.

 Supported platforms

Hu-Go! has became quite portable and runs on manu 
platform even if not all are supported officially (due 
to lack of time, knowledge and hardware).

Hu-Go! runs well on Solaris, FreeBsd. The same notes 
than Linux applies to them, excepted that cdrom isn't supported.

Hu-Go! is ported for Xbox by Xport, and documentation 
for this port are included in its distribution.

Hu-Go! is ported for BeOs, thanks to Caz. I don't have 
much details about it.

Hu-Go! is also ported to Sheldows.

Parts of Hu-Go! are found in GPEngine, the GP32 pc 
engine emulator.

There are certainly other ports and or derived work. 
I'd be glad to hear about them and include them here.

A dreamcast port is also in progress but I don't have 
much details.
