  <h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00020000000000000000">Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>This document briefly describes how to play pc engine games
  with Hu-Go! using two or more machines.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00030000000000000000">Principles</a></h1>

  <p>Hu-Go! supports playing games with some players being on
  remote machines, either on the lan or internet. It uses a
  specific protocol working on client-server principle. A server is
  started by one player on her machine and others players, as well
  as her, will start the usual Hu-Go! client and configure it to
  connect to the server instead of running locally.</p>

  <p>For each frame, each client will send its local input data.
  The server will collect them and dispatch them to all clients. On
  reception of this digest data, gathering input from every player,
  Hu-Go! will act as is it was the local devices which produced it
  and proceed to the next frame.</p>

  <p>The server is started either in command line or graphically,
  for a given protocol, awaitting for several &laquo;slots&raquo;
  to be filled. Those &laquo;slots&raquo; represent pc engine
  players which are embodied by some players on clients side.</p>

  <p>On client side, you &laquo;export&raquo; some local players to
  the server. For example, you can use the locally configured
  player 2 and 4 for playing in network. This client will then be
  considered as using 2 &laquo;slots&raquo; and will embody 2
  players, whatever the used local devices. Generally, you will
  export player 1, eventually also player 2. The server will
  reorganize players so that if everyone uses local device 1 (which
  is a common case), they will be actually assigned sequentially to
  global player 1, 2, 3, ...</p>

  <p>There's no restrictions on games run on each client. You
  should use the very same rom on each client, but you're free to
  use US and jap versions of games. Future versions will help
  preventing starting incompatible versions on clients side.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00040000000000000000">Protocols</a></h1>

  <p>To be more precise, Hu-Go! uses two slightly different
  protocols. They both uses UDP and can't be mixed. All clients and
  the server must be configured to use the same protocol.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>LAN protocol : This protocol suits local networks. It is
    reliable and latency-free but requires a low RTT between
    clients and server. In case of high RTT (for instance when
    trying over internet), the framerate is dropping to fit the
    latency.</li>

    <li>INTERNET protocol : This protocol suits client spread over
    internet. It is less reliable, but bear higher RTT. It induces
    latency between the time you press a button and the time it is
    seen by all (including yourself, since all clients should be
    synchronized). This latency should be the one between each
    client and the server.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00050000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00050000000000000000">Configuration</a></h1>

  <p>The netplay options can be found under
  &laquo;options-&gt;General settings ...&raquo; in the
  &laquo;Netplay&raquo; tab.</p>

  <p>The Netplay mode should be set to the desired protocol. Then
  you fill in the server hostname and port (which is by default
  25679).</p>

  <p>Finally, you &laquo;export&raquo; local devices to slots. You
  must first export slot 1, whatever the local device assigned to
  it. It you want to export another, use slot 2, etc... So, if you
  export 2 local devices, slots 3 et 5 should be
  &laquo;none&raquo;. You can't export slot 1 and 3 for example.
  That will be enforced in future version of the gui, but for now,
  it's up to you to respect this.</p>

  <p>Once done, you can start a game.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00060000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00060000000000000000">Firewall issues</a></h1>

  <p>If the server or client are behind firewall and/or nat
  devices, you can get around to make the whole stuff work. The
  server only receives data in UDP on the listening port (by
  default 25679) and send data back starting from the very same
  port. Usually firewall prevent incoming streams and allowing
  incoming data to UDP 25679 should do the trick.</p>

  <p>The client only send UDP traffic to the server port (still
  25679 by default) and will get traffic back from this port, from
  the server machine. On stateful firewalls, this is generally
  automatically allowed.</p>

  <p>Refer to your firewall provider documentation for exact
  instructions on how to allow those streams in and out.<br></p>
