Hu-Go! authors
==============

Hu-Go! is based on fpce, a pc engine emulator made by Bero.
Improvements done in Xpce, from Hmmx, were also integrated.
It contains code for unzipping by Gilles Vollant (unzip.[hc])
and relies on zlib (zlib team, zlib licencen, zlib.org), SDL (SDL team,
LGPL licence, libsdl.org), SDLnet (Sam Lantinga, Roy Wood and
Masahiro Minami, http://jcatki.no-ip.org/SDL_net/)
