Changes from HU-GO! 2.11 to HU-GO! 2.12

BUGZILLA 11: Now removes the temporary directory when quitting.
BUGZILLA 12: Quitting the main window also closes the game in progress
  so that exiting is immediate.

  if not present, compiles with the usual manipulation.
BUGZILLA 17: Fixed mapping of split roms, which was breaking many games
  or at least screwing graphics.
BUGZILLA 25: Readded screenshot support (in .ppm).
BUGZILLA 28: Added unzipping in memory, for cleaner, faster and more
  robust handling of zipped roms.

  to avoid multiple key pressed
Message displayed on the bottom left
Working synchronisation (In fact, limitation to 60 frame / sec.)
More roms recognized (519)
