Simplified license into GPL+mBSD (zlib licensed code is still there,
  but it is not required to make it part of the whole license)
BUGZILLA 11: Now removes the temporary directory when quitting.
BUGZILLA 12: Quitting the main window also closes the game in progress
  so that exiting is immediate.
BUGZILLA 15: Doesn't necessarily depends on SDL_net for compiling,
  if not present, compiles with the usual manipulation.
BUGZILLA 17: Fixed mapping of split roms, which was breaking many games
  or at least screwing graphics.
BUGZILLA 25: Readded screenshot support (in .ppm).
BUGZILLA 28: Added unzipping in memory, for cleaner, faster and more
  robust handling of zipped roms.
Fixed compilation scripts to allow to compile without all the
  documentation tools installed, also fixed debian packaging.
Cleaned sources a bit more.
